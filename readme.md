| 01 - JavaScript Drum Kit  | Aug 10, 2020  | JS: `querySelector`, event listeners<br>Cool CSS stuff: `transition`, `transform`<br>Not deviating from the video in my code |
| 02 - JS and CSS Clock     | Aug 11, 2020  | JS: `setInterval`<br>CSS stuff: `transform-origin` to change the position of transformed elements, here to make the clockhands pivot around the right-most end and not in the middle.<br>Managed to fix the bug where clockhands transition backwards to the beginning. |
| 03 - CSS Variables        | Aug 12, 2020  | JS: `querySelectorAll` gives you a node list which doesn't have the same methods as arrays.<br>CSS stuff: variables (--) |
