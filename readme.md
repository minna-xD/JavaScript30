| 01 - JavaScript Drum Kit  | Aug 10, 2020  | JS: `querySelector`, event listeners; cool CSS stuff: `transition`, `transform`<br>Not deviating from the video in my code; still learning this stuff :) |
| 02 - JS and CSS Clock     | Aug 11, 2020  | JS: `setInterval`, CSS stuff: `transform-origin` to change the position of transformed elements, here to make the clockhands pivot around the right-most end and not in the middle<br>Managed to fix the bug where clockhands transition backwards to the beginning. |
